# Weather-Data-Analytics-and-Forecast-Modelling
â€¢ Processed (100,000+ rows) weather records using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), detecting seasonal trends and anomalies. Improved forecast model inputs, increasing predictive accuracy by 12%.
## ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives

- Explore and visualize key weather patterns (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.)
- Clean and prepare time-series data for modeling
- Apply statistical methods and machine learning to forecast future weather
- Evaluate model performance using common metrics
- Provide visual and data-driven insights for decision-making
